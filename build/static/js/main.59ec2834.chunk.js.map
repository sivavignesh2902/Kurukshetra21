Prior to the development of plant cultivation, human beings were hunters and gatherers. The knowledge and skill of learning to care for the soil and growth of plants advanced the development of human society, allowing clans <br></br>and tribes to stay in one location generation after generation. Archaeological evidence indicates that such developments occurred 10,000 <br></br>or more years ago.\r\n                 </p>\r\n                 <p>Pinpointing the absolute beginnings of agriculture is problematic because the transition away from purely hunter-gatherer societies, in some areas, began many thousands of years before the invention of writing. Nonetheless, archaeobotanists/paleoethnobotanists<br></br> have traced the selection and cultivation of specific food plant characteristics, such as a semi-tough rachis and larger seeds, to just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 B.C.E.) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. There is much earlier evidence for use of wild cereals: anthropological and archaeological evidence from sites across Southwest Asia and North Africa indicate use of wild grain (such as from the ca. 20,000 B.C.E.<br></br> site of Ohalo II in Israel, many Natufian sites in the Levant and from sites along the Nile in the 10th millennium B.C.E.). There is even early evidence for planned cultivation and trait selection: grains of rye with domestic traits have been recovered from Epi-Palaeolithic (10,000+ B.C.E.) contexts at Abu Hureyra in Syria, but this appears to be a localized phenomenon resulting from cultivation of stands of wild rye,<br></br> rather than a definitive step towards domestication. It isn't until after 9,500 B.C.E. that the eight so-called founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer and einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas, and flax. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites in the Levant,<br></br> although the consensus is that wheat was the first to be sown and harvested on a significant scale.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/1_ujsvTUeEe5w-bzTxqIYI6w.28e5170f.jpeg\";","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport logo3 from './images/1_ujsvTUeEe5w-bzTxqIYI6w.jpeg'\r\nexport default class green extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <img src={logo3} />\r\n                <p><br></br>\r\n                he Green Revolution, or the Third Agricultural Revolution, is the set<br></br> of research technology transfer initiatives occurring between 1950 and the late 1960s, that increased agricultural production worldwide, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s.[1] The initiatives resulted in the adoption of new technologies, including high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of cereals, especially dwarf wheat and rice. It was associated with chemical fertilizers, agrochemicals, and controlled water-supply (usually involving irrigation) and newer methods of cultivation, including mechanization. All of these together were seen as a 'package of practices' to supersede 'traditional' technology and to be adopted as a whole.[2] The key elements of the revolution include : 1) Use of last capital and technological inputs . 2) adoption of modern scientific methods of farming. 3) use of high yielding varieties of seeds. 4) proper use of chemical fertilizers. 5) consolidation of land holdings.\r\n<br></br>\r\nBoth the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation were heavily involved in its <br></br>initial development in Mexico.[3][4] One key leader was Norman Borlaug, the \"Father of the Green Revolution\", who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. He is credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. The basic approach was the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers.\r\n<br></br>\r\nThe term \"Green Revolution\" was first used by William S. Gaud, the administrator of t<br></br>he U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in a speech on 8 March 1968. He noted the spread of the new technologies as:\r\n<br></br>\r\n\"These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a ne<br></br>w revolution.

The history of agriculturebegan thousands of years ago.<br></br> After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago.\r\n                    Modern agronomy,<br></br> plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices <br></br>in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to global warming, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and growth hormones in industrial meat production. Agriculture is also very sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation and global warming, which cause decrease in crop yield.[2]<br></br> Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some are banned in certain countries.\r\n                    </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport logo2 from './images/1_ujsvTUeEe5w-bzTxqIYI6w.jpeg'\r\nexport default class Advancement extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h1>Advancements</h1>\r\n                <img src={logo2} />\r\n                <p>\r\n                In order to further mitigate the adverse effects of food insufficiency and insecurity, countries must rely on technological innovations in the agricultural sector to keep up with increasing food demands. Here are five advancements to agricultural technology that aim to shift the paradigm of hunger and malnourishment for generations to come.\r\n\r\nSolar Mini-Grids in Myanmar: In Myanmar, solar mini-grids have played an important role in bringing electricity to hundreds of villages around the country, especially for rural and remote communities, where working mini-grids offer an opportunity to build resilience and farm sustainably. With partial funding from the World Bank and Parami Energy and with villagers  <br></br>covering the rest of the funding, 1,442 households connected to the mini-grid, changing the way many families live and increasing the productivity on their farms. Over the course of 2020, Parami Energy plans to connect 4,097 more homes to the mini-grid system, and by 2030, the government hopes to achieve national electrification for Myanmar.\r\nGPS-Enabled Cell Phones: Some are using GPS-enabled cell phones to monitor agricultural extension agents (AEAs) in Paraguay. In order to manage how people receive agricultural services, central governments often assign local supervisors some authority over processes. Even though the supervisors are knowledgeable about local affairs, they still may be unable to      <br></br>monitor the performance of workers. These GPS-enabled cell phones allow supervisors to see where AEAs are at all times, how much time they spend in each place and their reported activities with farmers. A research study found that the phones positively influenced the performance of AEAs, increasing the number of farmers they visited by 6%, 22% greater than the AEAs who did not receive monitoring.\r\nWaru Warus: A revamping of ancient agricultural technologies is coming to fruition in Peru, as sustainable practices increase in a nationwide fight against environmental challenges and poverty. Farmers use waru warus to irrigate crops and store water. This agricultural technology system, a mix of raised beds and irrigation channels, is an inexpensive way to improve <br></br>    crop yields and mitigate the detrimental effects of farming at 12,500 feet above sea level. Alipio Canahua, an agronomist working with the FAO, stated that waru warus capture “water when there are droughts and drain away water when there’s too much rain, meaning that it irrigates the crops all year round.”\r\nThe NextGen Cassava Breeding Project: The NextGen Cassava Breeding project (NextGen Cassava) aims to streamline cassava breeding facilities in Africa and efficiently deliver improved varieties of cassava with advanced technology. The beneficiaries of this project are cassava farmers of Africa, who receive improved cassava varieties and root yields that are more     <br></br>resilient to pests and diseases, and exhibit other desirable traits that farmers prefer. Disease-resistant varieties of cassava take a substantial amount of time to grow. However, with NextGen’s use of accurate computer modeling techniques, this time has reduced by half and much new information on the plant is on the Cassavabase open-source database for future use.\r\nRice Transplanters: Japan has widely used rice transplanters for efficient rice seedling planting. This machine aims to lessen the burden on farmers by reducing the need for manual labor in the rice-planting process. First, the rice planter creates a map of the rice field using a GPS while it moves around the perimeter of the field. The planter then calculates its  <br></br>planting route based on the map and automatically plants rice seedlings with the machine. A remote controller needs to monitor the machine, however, a person does not have to drive it, considerably reducing the amount of physical labor necessary.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","import './App.css';\nimport { Navbar,Nav } from 'react-bootstrap'\nimport { BrowserRouter,Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport History from './history';\nimport green from './green';\nimport About from './about';\nimport Advancement from './advancement';\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <BrowserRouter>\n    <div className=\"App\">\n    <Navbar collapseOnSelect expand=\"lg\" bg=\"success\" variant=\"dark\" sticky=\"top\">\n          <Navbar.Brand href=\"\">Blogging</Navbar.Brand>\n          <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls=\"responsive-navbar-nav\" />\n          <Navbar.Collapse id=\"responsive-navbar-nav\">\n            <Nav className=\"mr-auto\" sticky=\"top\">\n              <Nav.Link  href=\"/home\">About</Nav.Link>\n              <Nav.Link  href=\"/history\">History</Nav.Link>\n              <Nav.Link  href=\"/advancement\">Advancement</Nav.Link>\n              <Nav.Link  href=\"/greenrevolution\">Green Revolution</Nav.Link>\n\n\n            </Nav>\n          </Navbar.Collapse>\n        </Navbar>\n    </div>\n    <Switch>\n      <Route path=\"/home\" component={About} />\n      <Route path=\"/history\" component={History} />\n      <Route path=\"/advancement\" component={Advancement} />\n      <Route path=\"/greenrevolution\" component={green} />\n    \n    </Switch>\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
